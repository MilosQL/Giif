#### Editor selection

The original idea was to allow users to choose their editor of choice through `sensible-editor` script. However, editors like `vim` and `nano` do not work well under Guacamole-SSH for files longer than one screen page. Until this issue is resolved, we'll be using `mcedit` exclusively.
