### PAGW instance removal

These scripts serve to remove an undesired or no longer needed PAGW instance from the setup. 

They're typically invoked from the `../undeploy_and_clear.sh` script which also deletes the corresponding database records.

In some irregular cleanup scenarios, the operator may decide to run these scripts directly.
